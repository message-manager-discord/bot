# Contributing

Pipenv is used, to install development packages do `pipenv install --dev`

It is also suggested that you setup pre-commit, do this by running `pre-commit install` in the base directory

Before any commits run black (`black .`), isort (`isort .`), flake8 (`flake8`) and mypy (`mypy`)  
Note: these commands should all be run in the base directory of the repository
